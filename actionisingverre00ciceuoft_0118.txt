21. 52. ex lege Terentia et cassia.. This law was brought forward,
at the suggestion of the senate, by the consuls for B.c. 73. It
restored to the people the privilege of distribution of corn at a
nominal price, granted to them by a corn-law of C. Gracchus, 123
B.c.‚ but of which Sulla had deprived them in 82. It further laid
upon the provinces the duty of supplying corn at a fixed sum. From
Cic. 2 Verr. 3, c. 70, it appears that there were two modes of
purchasing corn from the provinces (cleto (fenera emendi suerzmt):
(i) The civitates decumanae had to supply decumae, or ‘tenths' of
their produce (in addition to their original impost), for which the
state paid at the rate of 3 sesterces a bushel ; (ii) a further amount
of 800‚000 bushels was levied proportionally on all the Sicilian
states (quod civitatibus aequaliter esset distributam), for which the
senate paid at the rate of 31¹2 sest. a bushel. The decumanae civitates
were therefore liable for both (i) and (ii); the Mamertines, being
immune& were liable only for (ii) qnod emeretur, but not for (i) quod

tenants of these lands (aratores) had to pay were ‘farmed out' by
the censors.

singulas decumas: i.e. the original ‘tithes ' which they would
naturally supply as ‘decumanae,' as distinct from the additional
quota levied on them, for which they received payment from the
senate (alterae decumae).

unaltered when Hiero's kingdom passed into the hands of Rome.

the whole of Sicily ; (ii) in note to §52

certe 2 O.’s argument is, if the Mamertines, as you say, were not
liable for ‘frumentum emptum,³ then none of the other states were 3
and the ‘ immunesss who were not even liable to the ‘ tithes ' (quod
