114 CICERO ΙΝ VERREM [50. 133

mortem communem. Communis was a common epithet of Mars
as being ‘ impartial,' favouring now one now another. Cf. ad Fam.
vi. 4, 1 : cum omnes belli Mars communis et cum semper incerti exitus
proeliorum sint : ‘ since the fortune of war is always equal and the
issue of battles ever uncertain.' Venerem communem is used in
sarcastic allusion to the ‘ impartiality ’ with which Verres dispenset]
his favours.

133. praecidas licet: ‘you may pass over this too‚’ a mild im-
perative: praeeiderezlit. to cut short one's remarks. Cf. de Senect.
16, 57, brem· praecidam : ‘ I will briefiy pass over.’

vertitur : ‘is concerned with? depends upon.' Cf. Livy xxxvii.
7, 8: Sed totum icc vertitur in voluntate Philippi: ‘but all this
depends upon P. ’s will!

in milites nostros. Serious breaches of discipline, such as mutiny
and desertion, were punished by death. Military punishments

134. mercedem lacrimarum: referring to the extortions of the
carnifex Sextius ἓ 118.

135. quapropter. See ἓ 131.

vacuum remum. A remus vacuus is an oar without a man to
work it. Long says ‘ tractus ’z ‘ attached to its place and drayqed
alony instead oi being worked by the hand of the 1·0wer,’ an arrange-
ment, one would think, most detrimental to getting much way on
the ship, to say nothing of the inconvenience caused to the other
oarsmen! Halm regards it as merely a stronger expression for
‘ carried,’ and it may simply imply the carrying of what was more
a hindrance than a help, and the expenditure of more than one's
due share of exertion.

tenebere. Note to ς 39.

52. 136-8. Α recapitulation of the charges brought against
Verres. Notice the skill with which C. in a perfectly natural and
consistent manner, without any apparent straining after effect,
