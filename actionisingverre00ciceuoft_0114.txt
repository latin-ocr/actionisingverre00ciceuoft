would be proclaiined at least 97 times. The division of the Roman
people into ‘centuries’ was introduced by Servius Tullius (578-
535 Rc. ). The whole of the Roman burgesses were divided into five
‘ classes’ in proportion to their fortune, each ‘classis’ containing
a certain number of ‘ centuriae ' of ⁸ seniores,' i.e. men over 46 years
of age, and of ‘iuniores‚’ between 17 and 46. Besides these there

which together formed the ‘Comitia Centuriata,’ the most im-

Comitia were (i) election of magistrates ; (ii) enactment or repeal of
laws ; (iii) hearing of criminal cases affecting the life or liberty of a
citizen.

qui . . . capiebat: ‘who, at the very time he was leaving his
