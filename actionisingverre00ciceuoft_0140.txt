63. 163. lex Porcia legesque S. Livy x. 9 says t Porcia lex gyrari
poena si quis verberasset necassetve civem Romanum sanxit. ‘The
lex Porcia enacted penalties for beating or killing a Roman citizen.’

leges semp. The ‘lex' of Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, B.c. 123,
‘ de prorocatione' made previous enactments on the subject more
severe, and extended the right of appeal to the army (Mommsen, iii.
p. 112). Cic. l. c.: G. Gracchus· legem tulit ne de capite civium
R. inin-ssu vestro iudicaretur. ‘ G. Gracchus brought in a law that
no Roman citizen should be tried on a capital charge without your
orders ’ (2‘.e. of the people).

tribunicia potestas. Sulla (no. 82-79) had sought to limit the
authority of the tribunes of the plebs by placing considerable
restrictions on their right of addressing the people whenever they
thought fit, and by practically annulling their power of veto on
any measure proposed by a magistrate by imposing a heavy fine on
the abuse of this right. He had also enacted that no tribune of
the plebs should be eligible for other magistracies (Mommsen, iii.
p. 363). These restrictions had been lately removed in B.c. 70 in
the consulship of Crassus and Pompeius.
