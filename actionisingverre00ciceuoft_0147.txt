conatus est. The attempt of Verres’ emissaries on this temple
was unsuccessful. The attendants were roused, and the whole city
turned out and drove off the plunderers with showers of stoncs. A

secure, and saved them, as Cicero sarcastically remarks, from
returning absolutely empty-handed to the sacrilegious robber.
