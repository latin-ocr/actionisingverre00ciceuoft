homine. The above rendering follows Halm and Eberhard, who
refer eo to the corrupt judge implied iu the previous clause. Long
reads putat-it, aud refers eo to Verres, translating ‘ whom they have
already considered unworthy of a trial (c. 63).’ As translated
above, the sentence conveys a double threat to the senatorial
judges; either impeachment before the people if they fail in their
duty, or before a new body of judges composcd, in part, of the
equites whose participation in the judicial prerogatives would bc
hastened by any dishonest verdict in the present case, by ensuring
the passing of the lex Aurelia. It is one more note of warning to
the senate that their tenure of the iudicia depends on their conduct
in this trial.

named Sapiens, was born of plebeian family about B.c. 234, and
served with distinction through the Second Punic XVar. He is the

sui generis mitium. Cato was the first of his family to hold any
curule office (Le. he was a novus homo), and thus was the first to
introduce into it the ius· inzagsz'nnm. See note to ἓ 36.

inimicitiae. In the cliv. in Caecil. ἓ 63 Cicero says z M. Catonem

M. Cato became the bitter enemy of many men, on account of the
injustice done to the Hispani‚’ referring to Cato’s denunciation of
