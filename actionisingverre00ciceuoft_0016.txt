so well in previous cases, and even boasted that he
had amassed sufficient wealth to enable him to live
the rest of his days in comfort, even if he had to dis-
gorge two-thirds of his ill-gotten gain in securing his
acquittal. Bribes were even offered to Cicero himself,
as he more than once leads us to believe3 but he
remained firm and above corruption, and the prose-
cution was inevitable. Verres had as his advocate the
illustrious Quintus Hortensius, the foremost orator of
the day and the acknowledged ‘king of the law-
courts’. Client and counsel set to work to hamper
the prosecution by every legal shift and device that
suggested itself. On the advice of Hortensius, Verres
took advantage of a peculiarity of Roman law and
put forward a creature of his own—one Q. Caecilius,
who had been his quaestor—to contest with Cicero
the right of undertaking the prosecution. When two
or more persons thus appeared to claim the right of
prosecuting the same man, they stated at length
before the court the grotmds on which they based
their claims, and the judges decided between them:
the process by which the court made choice between
the rival claimants was called Divinatio. Cicero's
speech on this occasion—Divinatio in Q. Caecilium—-
is still extant, and derives additional interest from the
fact of its being the only specimen of the kind that
has come down to us. The judges decided in Cicero’s
favour, and thus the first scheme of Verres was
thwarted.
