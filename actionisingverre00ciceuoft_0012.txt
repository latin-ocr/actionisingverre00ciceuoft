2. The trial has further a certain political interest,
which will be best understood from a brief survey of
the attitude of parties at this period. Previous to the
tribunate of the Gracchi (Rc. 133-123), the iudicia
had been in the hands of the senate, but were trans-
ferred by those patriots to the equites: Sulla, how-
ever, during his dictatorship (Rc. 81-79) restored the
judicia] power to the senate, a change which was far
from having satisfactory results. The senators proved
themselves as venal in the administration of justice as
they were feeble and incapable in the conduct of
foreign affairs. The miserable weakness and ineffi-
ciency they displayed in the management of the wars
against Sertorius, Spartacus, and the pirates3 the
open and acknowledged corruption of their tribunals3
their oppression and maladministration of the pro-
vinces, gave additional force to the reiterated demands
of the democratic party for the restitution of the
political rights of which Sulla had deprived them.
The hopes and aspirations of the democrats were
strengthened by the adhesion to their party of
Pompeius and Crassus, the two most powerful men at
Rome at that time—the former, by reason of his
popularity with the legions and his undoubted
military ability; the latter, on account of his colossal
wealth. The coalition thus formed in Rc. 71 sealed
the fate of the Sullan constitution and insured the
downfall of senatorial rule. Pompeius and Crassus
were elected consuls for the following year, and
immediately set to work to reverse Sufla’s enactmentS.
