REPETUNDAE.

Tne word Repetundae (sc. pecvniae) was applied in its most
restricted sense to the money or other valuable propert-y which a
provincial governor had illegally appropriated. In course of time
the meaning of the word was extended to embraee any act of
maladministration, oppression, or corruption on the part of such
governor, and was further made to cover the taking of bribes by
iudices, and, in general, any fraudulent proceeding on the part of
any magistrate in the discharge of his official duty. The word,

an almost unlimited field for amassing private wealth at the
expense of the unfortunate provincials. Law after law was
passed more clearly and closely defining the offence, with the
object of repressing the growing cupidity of magistrateS, but all
were equally inefficacious.

The first legislative enactment that dealt directly with the
subject was the Lea: Porcia of M. Porcius Cato, B.0. 198, which
apparently limited the amount which a governor could legally
demand from the provincials for the necessary expenses of ad-
ministration. The next law was the Lete Calpurnia, proposed in
Rc. 149 by L. Calpurnius Piso= a tribune of the people. By this
law the trial of cases of Repetundae was referred to a ‘standing
