verum hoc erat: C. here returns to the anacoluthon with which
he broke off in ἓ 73. ‘ No ! the truth was . . .'

certus locus, etc. Should V. secure acquittal on the charge of
‘repetundae,' he was still liable, C. hints, to another charge, viz„
that of ‘maiestas,’ for releasing, or, to accept his own statement,
for harbouring‚ a public enemy. (See book 1. c. 5). There were
several laws dealing with maiestas: the one referred to here was
probably the lea: Cornelia (8.0. 81), which more clearly defined the
various offences embraced under the term 3 cf. ξ 42. The trials for
‘maiestas’ were at this time conducted by one of the six ‘quaes-
tiones perpetuae ’ established by Sulla as standing criminal courts,
each one being presided over by a praetor.

[ubl terme denariis . . . permssa et data] This has little
bearing on the context and is with good ground suspected by Eber-
hard as an interpolation. The ‘frumentum at 3 denarii’ was the
corn provided by the provincials for the personal use of the praetor
and his suite, called ‘frumentum in cellam': the praetor had a
certain allowanee from the senate intended to cover the necessary
expense, and the price of the grain remained fixed at 4 sest. a

amount required in lieu of providing the corn, a custom which V.
had taken advantage of, exacting from the unlucky aratores
