10. Tfiocalino: (sc. agro). Diodorus xxxvi. 7, 3 (as quoted by
Halm) says Triocala got its name from possessing three natural
advantages (τρία καλά) viz, : good water, great fertility, especially
of the vine and olive, and natural strength rendering it almost
impregnable. It was for this reason, no doubt, that Trypho used
it as his headquarters during the second Servile warin Sicily. 11:

tum potuit . . . esse ratio. The sense is, ‘there were three
opportunities open to Verres: he could either have demanded a
sum of money from L. when he sent him notice to appear3 or he
could have proclaimed a suspension of judicial business (no new
device for him) and so have got the case put. off indefinitely3 or
third1y‚ he could have procured the acquittal of the slaves. But
when they had already been condemned what means had he of
procuring a bribe ¹? '

qui in consilio fuorunt : ‘ the members of the praetor’s court.'
Every provincial governor had a ‘ eonsilium’ or board of assessors to
