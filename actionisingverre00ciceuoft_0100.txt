80 CICERO IN VERREM [1. 3

quite within my rights' ; de Off. i. ξ lll: sermone eo debemus uti,
qui notus est nobis, oze iure summo (=deservedly) rideantur.

Siculorum testimoniis, The inhabitants of Sicily had become
considerably hellenised in Cicero’s time by the admixture of a
Greek clement with the native population. The Romans always
expressed much contempt for the degenerate Greeks of this period
(cf. (Ze Orat. i. ἓ47, Juv. iii. 78). The implied inferiority of the
Sicilians to the Romans is brought out more forcibly by the juxta-
position of Romano Siculorum.

3. M’. Aquini: Consul in B.c. 101. He obtained a triumph for
his success in quelling the servile insurrection in Sicily, headed
by Athenio (see note tq 1. 1.), but was afterwards accused by
L. Fufius of maladministration, and, though the evidence against
him seems to have been overwhehning‚ he secured an acquittal
through the eloquence of M. Antonius, and his own reputation as
a general (Cic. pro Flacc. 39, 98, (Ie Orac. ii. 28, 124; 47, 194,
de Off ii. 314, 50).

Μ. Antonii. The grandfather of the triumvir, born Rc. 143,
Consul Rc. 99. Cicero frequently mentions him with great admira-
tion for his eloquence : (Eloquencz'ssimus- omnium quo-5· eqo audierim,
Tusc. v. 19, ἓ 55), and considered him and Crassus as the greatest
orators of their age (Brut. ἓ 138 fou). He is one of the chief
speakers in Cicero’s treatise de Oratore; he was ‘specially dis-
tinguished for his readiness and skill in the invention of arguments,
for the art with which he arranged them, and for the tenacious
memory, owing to which he was never at a loss, and always avoided
the appearance of undue elaboration . . . Hence he is made to
discourse on the subjects of inventio, collocatio, and memoria in bk. ii.
In the other books he appears mainly as the champion of practice as
opposed to theory' (Prof. Wilkins’s Introduction to the cle Oratore).

tunicam . . . abscidit. cf. cle Orat. ii. 28, 124: in causa
peroranda non dubitavit excitare reum consularem (Μ’. Aquilium)
et eius diloricare tunicam et iudicibus cicatrices adversas senis im-
peratoris ostendere. ‘At the close of his case he did not hesitate
to set the consul up in the midst and tear open the tunic and show
the judges the scars on the aged general's breast.’

hostium duce: τῖε. Athenio.

4. ratio viaque. These two terms are frequently found joined
together in a sort of hendiadys: ratio = ‘theory,' via = course,
method, line (of defence, etc.). Cf. cle Orat. i. 19, 87, hanc ipsam
dicendi rationem ac viam. So Cic. (Ze Pin. i. 9, 29, ut ratione et ria
procedat oratio : ‘ according to a scientific method.'
