the following year. See Introd. §IL

lege : the leo: Aurelia of L. Aurelius Cotta (13.0. 70) which enacted
that the iudices should be chosen equally from the senators,
equites and tribuni aerarii, and not from the senators alone, as
under the Sullan constitution. Momm. iv. p. 95.

promulgandam. This was the technical word for making known
a proposed new law before it was actually discussed in the Comitia.

actual terms of the bill were not published till after the summary
conclusion of the trial of Verres (tle. till after the actio prima),
though various proposals were being made for some change in the

supposing him to be undergoing a second indictment (see Appendix),
and says that the lex was immediately proposed when Verres was
thought to be gaining fresh energies and support (by bribery), zze.
during the interval between the first and second hearing. Cf. sua
spe atque opinione quam cle robis· habet : above.

aut populus R„ etc. : ‘either the Roman people will pass judg-
ment upon that man, whom they will already have considered
unworthy of the office of judge3 or those men, who, through the
misconduct of the cour-ts, shall by the new law be appointed new
judges, will pass judgment on the late judges.' The meaning is
not very clear, owing to the uncertainty of who is meant by eo
