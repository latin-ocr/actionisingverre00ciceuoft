82 CICERO IN VERREM [3. 7

ut ne quis servus esset: ‘uc ne is used when a precaution or
restriction is to be indicated, especially after ὕει’ (for which we
have here eius modi). Madv. 456, obs. 4. Cf. ἓ 8, ut ne quod bellum
posset exsistere, and ἓ 52.

cum telo: Gaius says: ‘ the name telum is applied commonly to
that which is discharged from a bow, but now signifies anything
discharged from thc hand.' Hence=any missile weapon, whether
for war or for the chase.

vetus : ‘ an old story.'

1.. Domitium: L. Domitius Ahenobarbus (No. 5 in Dict. Bioy.)
consul B.c. 94, was praetor in Sicily about the close of the second
Servile war.

pastorem. These shepherds, who tended the fiocks and herds in
the mountains during the summer, were provided with arms for
their own defence against the attacks of wild beasts, and the
‘venabulum' used by the slave in question was probably only
carried for this purpose. Varro, R. R. ii. 10, gives an interesting
account of the life led by these shepherds.

qui percussisset: old abl. of quis=how? Cf. qui fit, ut . .
Madv, 88, obS. 2.

in crucem subl. The punishment by impalement or crucifixion
was only inflicted on slaves and the worst sort of criminals (cf.
Juv. Sat. vi. 219, Pone crucem servo. Hor. Sat. i. 3, 80 foll.) ; hence
the act of Verres in crucifying a Roman citizen was all the more
flagrant. Cf. ἓ 168.

videatur ε hypothetical subj. with condition not expressed. Roby
ἓ 1536.

unam in partem : ‘I do not argue either one way or the other ;’
‘ either for or against.’

dissolutum: ‘lax.' Cf. ἕ 104.

4. 8. c. Norbanus. As trib. plebis in Rc. 103 (not 95 as in Dice.
Bioy. See Momm. iii. p. 186 note), N. impeached Q. Servilius
Caepio of ‘maiestas’ during his consulship in Gaul B.c. 106 and
secured his condemnation. In Ro. 95 he was, however, himself
impeached for the part he had taken in this prosecution, but was
acquitted. He was defended on this occasion by M. Antonius, who
gives an account of his defence in the de Orat. (ii. 48, 49; iii. 21,
25, 39, 40). He was praetor of Sicily B.C. 89, and consul B.c. 83.
He espoused the Marian cause, but was defeated by Sulla and fied
to Rhodes, where, on a demand being made by Sulla for his person,
he committed suicide B.c. 82.
