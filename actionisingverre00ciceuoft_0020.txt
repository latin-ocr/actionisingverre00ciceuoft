the funds voted for its maintenance‚ reduced to such
a state of inefficiency, that the pirates had found it an
easy prey3 and shows how the praetor, to shield
himself from the blame of these reverse& put the
captains of the vessels to death with great cruelty: in
the third part (53-67) Cicero charges Verres with the
most heinous crime of which a Roman magistrate
could be guilty—the torture and execution of Roman
citizens without a full trial before the people, who
alone could decide a question concerning the life and
death of one of their number. It will be observed
that the charges contained in the fifth book do not
properly fall under the law for repetumlae under
which Verres was accused3 Cicero has introduced
them, with much rhetorica-l skill, at the very close of ⁷
his accusation, to come with all the force of their
enormity and leave a lasting impression on the minds
of the judges as they retire to consider their verdict.

13. Halm considers the Verrine orations as one of
the finest monuments of ancient eloquence. Besides
their importance and interest for the antiquarian with
respect to the information they contain on the subject
of Roman provincial government, they have a special
rhetorical value in the richness of their matter, the
clearness of their proofs‚ the lofty swing and fire of
their diction, and their varied and ever—changing
style, which never suffers the interest of the reader to
fail.
