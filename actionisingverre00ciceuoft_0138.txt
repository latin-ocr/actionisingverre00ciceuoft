118 CICERO IN VERREM [56.146

immanitate: ‘herd of monsters,' abst. for concrete. cf. ser-
vitium, etc. ξ 9, note.

146. charybdim, Scyllam. Two monsters who gave their names
to two rocks situated in the straits between Italy and Sicily ; they
were both formidable to sassors, the former being said to swallow
down the waters of the sea thrice a day, and thrice throw them up
again; the latter was represented as surrounded by fierce hounds,
hence C.’s allusion in ‘ canibus,’ by which he means of course the
‘monsters' in the retinue of Verres. In describing this locality‚
Smyth (Sicily, p. 107) says: ‘Moderns of intelligence in visiting
this spot have gratified their imaginations with fancying it the
scourge of seamen, and that in a gale its caverns “ roar like dogs '' 3
but I, as a sailor, never perceived any difference between the effect

of the surges here and on any other coast, yet I have frequently
watched it closely in bad weather.'

pleniores : ‘ with richer cargo.’ Sertorianos, note to ξ 72.

Dianio ε a promontory (and fort) on the East coast of Spain, used
by Sertorius as a base for naval operations. It got its name from
a temple of Diana erected on its height.

eas ipsas : attracted for ea ipsa (argumenta) causa-3 esse.

57, 147. institutis: ‘ proeeedings‚’ practices) See ἓ 8.

iuous sold in the breast of the toga used as a pocket. See the
vwoodcut in Becker's Gallus, p. 414.

rationem carceris : ⁶ the prison-r011.'

148. ita defendere: ‘urge this plea‚' viz: that they had all
died.

ἑδικαιώθησανι a Sicilian provincialism or euphemism for ‘they
were executed,' a meaning which Cicero says Verres was too care-
less (dissolutas) to note (attendere) and too illiterate (barbarus) to
understand (intelleyere). Notice the chiasmus in which attendere
refers to dissolutus and intelleyere to barbarus. See Roby, vol. i.
p. 481.

58, 149. natio: ‘tribe,’ generally used of uncivilised people )(
qen-s.

151. superiore ex loco: ele. from the rostra or raised platform
from which magistrates addressed the people. Cicero refers to the
charge of matrs-{as which, when he became curule aedile, he would
bring against Verres, if he were aequitted on the present charge.
