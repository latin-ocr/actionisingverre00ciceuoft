90 CICERO IN VERREM [12. 30

universal, but ξ 14, incredibili quodamza. really incredible. Cf.
ξ 188 : nefario quodam fecrore : ‘with a madness amounting to crime.’

30. ubi primum, etc. ς ‘ where the bay begins to curve in towards
the city.’ The precise locality is more specifically mentioned in
ξ 80, iu litore, quod est litas· in Insula Syracusis post Arethusae fontem,
where Insula=Ortygia‚ an island between the Greater and Lesser
Harbours, connected with the mainland, and containing a part of
the town of Syracuse.

quae regis Hieronis fuit. Cf. iv. ξ 118 : in qua (Insula) domas est,
qnae Hieronis reyisfuit, qua praetores uti solent. Hiero was tyrant
of Syracuse 478-467 Ro.

filius. In ξ 81 he is alluded to as praetextatus, i. e. still with the
tossa praetem-ta, or boy’s toga ; and in iii. ξ 159 he is called orandis,
tall for his years : from these three passages we may infer that he
was not far off 17. Cf. Ramsay, Man. Antiq. p. 422.

si . . . abriperet . . . cogeret. See note to ξ 18, si facerent.

patris. Cf. iii. 68 fin„ Roby ἓξ 1314, 1317. Madvig on Cic.
(Ze Fz‘n. v. 5, says: Cicero uses the (senitire with similis, when the
object is a living being (especially a god or man), far more
frequently than the dative: the cases in which the dative occurs
being so rare by comparison as to give rise to doubt whether the
text should not be altered. XVhere the object is a chiny, he uses
either case indiscriminately. Of later writers, Livy prefers the
genitive, and the Augustan poets (Vergil, Horace, etc.) almost
universally employ the dative whether the object be a person or
thing. The personal pronoun however is always in the genitive.
Cf. ἕ 55 72..

31. [ab Rhodio tibicine] bracketed by Halm as unsuitable to the
participle perducta, and a probable gloss taken from iii. 78: Ter-
tiam vi abductam ab R. tibicine.

turbas : ‘ bickerings‚² ‘ quarrelling.'

mimi: for the mimi (the same name is given both to the plays
and the actors), see Momm. iv. pp. 579, 580.

iste Hannibal. This is supposed to be a reference to a line of
Ennius (quoted by Cicero pro Balbo c. 22 fin.) in which he makes
Hannibal say: hostem qai feriet milei eric Karthayiniensis Quisquis
eric: ‘he who shall smite the foe, shall be a Carthaginian to me,
whosoever he be.’ ’

13. talarique tunica. The tunic ⁶ extending to the ankles ' with
long sleeves (manicata) was regarded as very effeminate and foppish.
It was not a Roman costume but was introduced from Greece.
Cf. Cic. Cat. ii. 10. Hor. Sat. i. 2, 25: Maltinus manicis demissis
