122 CICERO ΙΝ VERREM [67. 171

67. l7l—End. The peroration to the whole of the five books of
the accusatio.

inanima. Some editors give inanimata, which Madvig (de Fin. iv.
36) shows to be an un-Cicei’onian form.

iste civis R..: Verres. Cicero says he ought not to have any
apprehension that the Senators will not regard Verres as deserving
of crucifixion, though they consider that punishment as most
unsuitable for Roman citizens in general. Some editors omit uon
before nuuc, taking ciri-s to refer to Gavius.

172. tandem: ‘pray.’

veritas: ‘the undoubted fact‚' viz. that all Roman citizens are
sprung from one stock and so sanquine coniuncti.

173. ratio: ‘my calculations.’

potestatem apud se agendi. Cicero had been elected as curule
aedile for the following year, an office which would give him the
right of addressing the people (ayere cum populo) which he had not
as privatus. Cf. Actio i. 36 ; 011 the powers of the curule aedile see

me agente ε ‘on my prosecution’ of Verres. Cicero had threatened
that if Verres was acquitted on the present charge of repetundae he
would impeach him for peculatus, appropriation of public funds:
if unsuccessful here, he would charge him with maiestas (see ἓ 42) ε
if that failed, then he would accuse him, before tlte people, of perduellio.
The trial for maie-stas would take place before a special court
appointed to hear such charges—one of the quaestiones perpetuae or
permanent commissions ; the charge of perduellio would be heard
and decided by the people-—hence the allusion in the text to sui-s
szffuzyiz's. Cf. bk. i. c. 5 and Ramsay, Mau. Antiq. p. 300.

ante Kal. Feb. ε 228. before he had been a month in office.

ad illud p. R. iudicium. Cf. bk. i. c. 5: mihi credite, arctioribue
apud populum R. laqueis tenebitur.

probabilis et facilis ι ‘ admitting of easy proof,⁷ ‘ easily proved.’

de uno crescere: ‘to gain honour at the cost of Verres alone.’
Cf. pro cluent. ἕ 77 : ut erc senatoria invidia pos-eet creseere ι ‘ that he
might make capital out of the unpopularity of the senate.’

68. delecto consilio z ‘ select body ’ of judges : a certain number
of citizens were annually chosen by the praetor urbanus to serve
during the year as iudices in the ‘permanent commissions ' 3 the list
of men thus chosen was called album iudicum, from whom the
requisite number was taken by lot for each trial, and these were
further liable to rejection (reiectio) by either party to the suit. See
Ramsay, Mau. Antio. p. 294 ; Cic. pro Cluent. ξ 121 3 and Appendix.
