something or other, as he said.’

in nominibus numeratam. Nomen, the name of a creditor entered
in the ledger, was used for ‘ a debt ' : hence ‘ in nominibus '=stand-
ing to one’s credit,' ‘owed to one.' Cf. ‘2 Verr. i. 10, nomina
eaeiyere=to collect debts: numeratam=lit. ‘paid down,' ‘ready
cash.’ Cf. numeravit pecuniam ἕ 15, supra.

mus, si aliquid attulimus, ‘whatever we have contributed to the
welfare of the state, {f anythiny!
