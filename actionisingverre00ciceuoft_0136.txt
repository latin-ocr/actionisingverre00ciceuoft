116 CICERO ΙΝ VERREM [54.141

which he had trumped up in the name of a certain slave. Servilius
appears at Lilybaeum, but no accuser is forthcoming. Verres,
however, requires him to pay a sum of money as a guarantee ‘that
he is not acquiring a livelihood by ‘chem’ offering to appoint some
of his own retinue as arbiterS. Servilius proteste, and is ac-
cordingly beaten to death. These are the facts that we gather
from Cicero, but we know that no slave could be a party to a suit,
and so we are met at the outset by a difficulty of ‘ Venerius servus.’
We must either accept Cicero's statements and make the best of
them, or suppose that Verres treated the law with such contempt
as to allow a slave, nominally at least, to appear as plaintiff ;
though in this case it is not easy to see why he should try to give
a legal colour to his proceedings at all.

Vadimonium promittere. Vadimonium was the ‘ bail ’ demanded
of the defendant by the plaintiff for his appearance on a fixed day
to answer to his charge. The plaintiff was said—vadari aliquem,
the defendant vadimonium promittam see ἓ 34. For Lilybaeum
used pregnantly for ‘to appear at L.,’ cp. bk. iii. 78: promittunt
Herbitenses· vadimonium Syracusas.

Venerio servo : a slave in the temple of Venus at Eryx.

sponsionem facere. This was a legal form by which two persons
entered into ‘ a sort of judicial wager' as Ramsay calls it (Man.
Antiq. p. 283). It was called ‘sponsio’ from ‘spondeo,' the word
employed by both parties ; e. 9. A. would say to B. ε ‘ If I can prove
you are making a livelihoocl by theft‚ do you agree (Spondesne) to
give me a cert-ain sum? ’ to which Β. would answer z ‘ Ι do (spondeo).'
Both A. and B. were equally said spon-sionem facere. The amount
was forfeited by the losing party.

milium: the exact number of thousand sesterces is wanting in

ni furtis . . . faceret. The actual words of the formulae in this
case would be 2—-Lictorz ‘ si furtis quaestum facis, mihi dare
nummos, Servili, spondes? Servilius: ‘Spondeo.’ When this is
put indirectly si becomes ni ; ‘ the substitution of ozi, in affirmative
wagers, for the si of the formulae, being probably due to the risk
which the plaintiff runs, and the exception which, if proved, would
free him from this risk, being chiefly regarded.' Roby ii. p. 331,
note. Cf. cle Off iii. 77: cum 22³· sponsionem fecis-set, ni vir bonus
essetzto beforfeiterk {f he were not a good man.
