104 CICERO IN VERREM [29. 76

76. liberum: Le. free from restraint3 in which you were a free
agent.

M. Glabrionem : the presiding magistrate at the ‘ first aclio.'

intra moenia=intra urbem.

30. 77. si aliquam : see ξ 8, si αῖῖριιῖιις manum: ‘ an armed
band.¹

itane vero? ‘ did you really? ⁷

defendes ε in its original sense of ⁶ ward off.'

de foro in capitolium. The course of the ‘ triumphus' was along
the Via Sacra (between the Coelian and Esquiline hills), through
the Forum, aud thus up to the Capitol. The prison here mentioned,
the Tullianum, stood at the point where the procession turned off
from the Forum to ascend the Capitoline hill.

78. et nunc . . . tuo pericu-lo viveret. This difficult sentence is
made more involved by the parenthetical clauses introduced. The
main sentence is: et nunc cuiquam credo esse flubium, quin tu id
commi-§mas uonfzteri-5‚ ut ille archipirata non potius secure· feriretur,
quam tuo periculo rit-eret: the meaning of which is: ‘and now, I
imagine, one doubts that your object would not have been that this
pirate-chief should noc rather be executed, than live at your peril ’ z
<the two negatives balance and destroy one another, i.e.) ‘your
object would have been that he should be executed rather than live
at your peril, {f you had not been bribed. This last clause in italics
is the supplement to be supplied to ‘quin commissurus fuerisss which
forms an anacoluthon. cuiquam cred0‚ ete„ is οἱ course ironical,
and cuiquam is used on account of the impliesl negative in credo.

quod . . . positum: the antecedent to qnod is the sentence tuo
periculo viveret.

si esset mortuus : i. e. while he was in your custody.

probare : ‘ pass for,² ; cf. pro Mil. ξ 65; mirabar volnus in latere,
quod acu punctum rideretur, pro ictu yladiatoris probari z ‘I
wondered that the wound in his side, which seemed but the prick
of a needle, should pass for the thrust of a gladiator.’ Ter. Eun. ii.
3, 84 : praeterea forma ετ aetas ipsa-ft, facile ut pro eunucho probes.

79. nescio quem istum: ‘ some creature or other of yours,’ cf.
Tic-sc. disp. 3, 6: minime assentior iis qui istam nescio qnam in-
dolentiam laudant ε ⁵ I by no means agree with those who extol that
freedom from pain of which you speak, whatever it ‘may be.' See
also ἓξ 156, 170.

tamen: you are scoffed at even when you produce the fellow
alive, what would you have said, pray, if he had escaped . . . ⁴!

Nico : otherwise unknown.
