AVTROD (JCTlfflv ix

The tribunician power was restored: the question of
the iudicia was settled by the Iar Aurelia„ passed
late in Rc. 70, by which it was ordained that the
iudices should bc chosen equally sr0111 thc senators,
equites, and tribuni aerarii3 and finally the censor-

· shipsabolished by Sulla, was reinstitutcd.

3. It was during the excitcment which preceded
the passing of the lex Aurelia, but before the actual
terms of the bill had been made known (ef. ξ 178,
eum primo slyer& coepimus, lea: νοη emt promulyata,
and note), that the prosecution of Verres took place.
Cicero constantly reminds the senatorial iudices how
preearious was their tenure of the iudicia. He
exhorts them to take this golden opportunity,
‘tempus divinitus clatum,' to free their order from
the infamy and contempt they had incurred : they as
well as the accused, he said, were on their trial, for
the eyes of all were upon them, jealously watching
to see if they would condemn a wealthy criminal : the
aequittal of Verres would be capable of but one inter-

” pretation3 his just condemnation would insure the

continued enjoyment' of their judicial rights
4. Gaius Verres (his gentile name is nowhere men-
tioned) was the son of C. Verres a man of senatorial
rank, as we learn from Cicero (bk. 11. ἓ 95). He makes
his first appearance in history in the year ΒΕ. 82,
when he served. as quaestor to Gnaeus Papirius
Carbo, one of the leaders of the Marian party. He
deserted him, however, at Ariminum, and went over to
Sulla, taking with him the military chest (see ξ 152).
