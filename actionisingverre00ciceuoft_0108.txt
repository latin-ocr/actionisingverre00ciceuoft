victory at Pydna over Perseus, king of Macedonia, Rc. 168;
rationem ac disciplinam ε ‘ method and art,' ‘ taeticsst

26. fluminum. ‘The violent rains that deluge the island at this
period of the year swell the rivers, damage the roads, and set the
F iumare running: these are torrents, occasioned by the waters
descending from the mountains into deep ravines . . . The boister·
ous force of the Fiumare while flowing, the badness of the roads
and the want of bridges, render travelling in the winter dangerous
and at times wholly impracticable.'—(Smyth’s Sicily, p. 7.)

continebatur: ‘ consisted of '3 some MSS. give ‘ conterebatur.'

27. Favonio. The blowing of the west wind, Favonius or Zephy-
rus, was the sign that spring had commenced. Cf. Hor. od. i. 4 :
Sol vitm· acris hiemps yram rice veris el Favoni. Halm quotes Varro
R. R. i. 28 : primus dies est veris in Aquario.

rosam: the latest blooming flower of spring. Cf. Hor. od. i.
38 ι rosa quo locorum sera moretur, ‘ where the late rose lingers.’

11. lectica octaphoro: ‘a litter with eight bearers.' These
lecticae were introduced into Rome from the east. At first they
were only used by sick persons or on a journey, and it was regarded
as a sign of effeminacy for a man to use them in the city ; sub-
sequently however they came into more general use, and were
furnished in most luxurious style with curtains and cushions (Juv.
Sat. i. 159). The number of hearers varied. JuV. Sat. i. 64
mentions one borne by six slaves Cf. also JuV. Sat. iii. 242:
clausa lectica fene-stra3 and for a general description Becker's
Gallu-e, p. 341 foll.

Melitensis: of fine Maltese linen. Cf. 2 l'err. 2, 72, 176: vestem
*Helicen-§cvm 74, 183: Meliten-<ica

maculis: ‘meshes.’

iura discripserat : ‘ dispense justice to each applicant.' Cf. cle Offi
i. 124, iura discribere; Cat. i. 4, 9: cli-‹cripsisti urbis partes ad in-
cendia ε ‘ allotted the various quarters of the city, to be set on fire.’

28. in quibus consistere, etc. From ‘2 Verr. 2, ξ 63, it appears
that Sicily was divided into four districts for judicial business.
The praetor went round ‘on circuit' once a year, stopping (con—
sistere) and holding assemblies (conventu-3 agere) at the chief town
of each district in turn. The four towns were Syracuse, Agri-
gentum, Panhormus, and Lilybaeum.

conventum agere. Cf. forum, iudicium, coetus affere.
