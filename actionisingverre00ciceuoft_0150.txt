130 CICERO IN VERREM

cominission’ (Quaestio perpetua), all previous methods of dealing
with such cases having proved unsatisfactory. The commission
was presicled over by the Praetor Peregrinus, the iudices being
chosen from the Senate and serving for a year—hence the term
‘perpetuali The lex further provided that only foreigners could
maintain an Actio Repetundarum. Roman citizens under similar
circumstances could recover by the ordinary civil processes. The
next enactment of importance was the Lesc Servilia (2 Rc. 106)
proposed by the Tribunus Plebis, O. Servilius Glaucia, by which
not only provincial governors but all magistrates were made
equally liable to prosecution for the abuse of their judicial power.
The law also introduced into cases De Repetunclis a peculiar
arrangement called comperendinatio, by which all such trials were
divided into two distinct parts—actio prima and secunda : in the
first of which the accuser sketched out the case in outline and the
defender replied, witnesses being examined and cross—examined.
No verdict, however, was given at the first hearing, but the case
was adjourned till the next day but one (perendie—hence the
name) when the trial proceeded and a verdict was pronounced.
(Verres anticipated the coccio secundet by voluntary exile, hence a
verdict was in his case given after the actio prima.) Under this
law, too, Iudices to the number of 450 were annually chosen by
the presiding praetor from non-senators, from whom the requisite
number were taken by lot for each case—both parties to the suit
having the right of rejecting a certain number. The penalty
fixed by the lex was twice the amount of the extortion proved to
have been committed. This law was followed in Rc. 101 by the
Iex Acilia, passed by M. Acilius Glabrio, which took away the
‘comperendinatio' which had been allowed by the lese Servilia.
Then came the lex Cornelia of Sulla, B.c. 81, which restored the
‘comperendinatim' and, among other provisions, euacted that a
provincial governor should be held liable to prosecution if he took
money for the purpose of having statues erected to him and
failed to have the statues set up within five years3 and that no
aedile should borrow works of art from the provinces for the
adornment of their shows at Rome. The penalty was increased to
four times the amount of the extortion, with the additional
punishment of outlawry (iqnis et aquae interdictio), and provisions
were made for tracing and recovering any of the plunder that
