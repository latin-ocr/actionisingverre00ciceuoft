td tempus: ‘at the right time‚’ i.e. at an appointed honr. Cf.
Livy xxxviii. 25: cum consul ad tempus venisset : so (mee tempus,
‘before the right time, prematurely.' Cic. (le Am. 3, ll ε factus
est comul bis, primum ante tempus, itm-um sibi suo tempore.

quae ln poculis ponebantur: i.e. the rules and regulations as to
the strength and quantity of the wine drunk, the number of toasts
to be honoured, and all other details of the feast. These rules
were settled by a ‘ master of the revels,' arbiter bibendi, elected by
lot before the feast began3 cf. Hor. Od. ii. 7, 25: quem Venus
(=the highest throw with the dice) arbitrum dicet bibendi: od. i.
4, 18: nec reqna vini sortiere talis: ‘nor wilt thou with the dice
obtain the lordship of the revels.' See Becker's Gallus, pp. 126-7.

pugnam can. Perhaps ‘ shambles’ is the nearest English equiva-
lent to this metaphor‚ which Cicero uses elsewhere somewhat differ-
ently to describe the Sullan proscriptions. Rosc. Am. 32 {⁵1 89: te
puq‘na Cannensis accusatorem sat bonumfceic.

offendit. Madvig thinks the whole passage from qnod el familiae
. . . non impedit refers to the slaves, and gives the various reasons
why they should be incited to insurrection at this period of the
year; the slave-gangs were collected together and they could see
their numerical strength: their labours in the harvest field were
most toilsome and would render them more prone to revolt: they
would have a supply of corn ready for their forces : and the season
of the year was propitious for a campaign. The appearance of the
praetor would do much to remind the slaves of the powerful city
they would have to contend with, and his mere presence might
eheck an incipient revolt. Halm also takes the passage in this
way, but Long finds some difficulty in accepting Madvig’s inter-
pretation, and thinks that ‘frumenti . . . impedic' refers to the
praetor, though in what way he does not make quite clear. He also
questions Madvig’s explanation of ‘labor . . . offendit,’ but says it
is difficult to suggest the real meaning. Madvig’s interpretation
appears the more natural and intelligible, even though some of the
supposed inducements to rebellion may, on a too close and hyper-
critical examination, appear insufficient.

For offendic=‘irritates,’ ‘is irksome to‚' cf. acl Fam. i. 7, 7: αι
