Sulla however seems to have viewed his new adherent
with suspicion, though he rewarded his treachery
with a grant of some confiscated territory at Beneven-
tum (bk. Ι. ξ 38).

praetor of Cilicia, Bc. 80-79, a man of kindred spirit

for when the former was impeached for extortion by
M. Scaurus in ΒΕ. 78, Verres gave evidence against
him, and, stipulating for a pardon for himself, was

chiefly instrumental in seciu¹ing the condemnation of
his chief.

Verres purchased his election to the city-praetorship

public buildings: letting out contracts to those who
feed him best: selling his edicts to the highest
